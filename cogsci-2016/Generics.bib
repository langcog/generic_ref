@article{Chierchia:1998,
	Abstract = {This paper is devoted to the study of bare nominal arguments (i.e. determinerless NPs occurring in canonical argumental positions) from a crosslinguistic point of view. It is proposed that languages may vary in what they let their NPs denote. In some languages (like Chinese), NPs are argumental (names of kinds) and can thus occur freely without determiner in argument position; in others they are predicates (Romance), and this prevents NPs from occurring as arguments, unless the category D(eterminer) is projected. Finally, there are langauges (like Germanic or Slavic) which allow bothpredicative and argumental NPs; these languages, being the 'union' of the previous two types, are expected to behave like Romance for certain aspects of their nominal system (the singular count portion) and like Chinese for others (the mass and plural portions). This hypothesis (the 'Nominal Mapping Parameter') is investigated not just through typological considerations, but also through a detailed constrastive analysis of bare arguments in Germanic (English) vs. Romance (Italian). Some general consequences of this view, which posits a limited variation in the mapping form syntax into semantics, for current theories of Universal Grammar and acquisition are considered.},
