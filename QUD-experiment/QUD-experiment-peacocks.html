<p><b>Sentence Judgment Experiment</b></p>

<p class="block-text">Your will read descriptions of conversations between two speakers. In each conversation, one of the speakers says something about an animal or object. 
Your task is to judge whether this sentence is about a <b>type</b> of animal or object, about a <b>specific</b> animal or object, or about a <b>specific group</b> of animals or objects.</p>

<p class="block-text">There are about 40 sentences for you to judge. 
The HIT should take about 5 minutes. </p>

	<p class="block-text" id="blurb">In this experiment you will see a sequence of about 40 conversations between <span class='name1'></span> and <span class='name2'></span>.
	In most of these interactions, <span class='name1'></span> will ask <span class='name2'></span> for some sort of information and <span class='name2'></span> will respond. In other cases, <span class='name2'></span>
	will offer information without any prompting from <span class='name1'></span>.</p>
	
	<p class="block-text" id="blurb">For each of these interactions, you will indicate whether <span class='name2'></span>'s statement is about a <b>type</b> of animal or object, about a 
<b>specific</b> animal or object, or about a <b>specific group</b> of animals or objects. </p>
